  2. Connect Data Structures to your career
  3. Set-up your Required IDE (this will take some time!)
  4. Read the [syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11yEERg09nUcVji8k9yzUr6asPgpxqpVKSeccP5p4wOQ/edit?usp=sharing) to understand the course structure

  6. Introduce yourself to the class and the TAs on Slack

- An additional assignment has been posted with a longer deadline. See [A01: Interview with a CSC 236 TA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NtM4BUvfbsyYlgH63H92zRcvMYrIIYVDortntHz_nxg/edit?usp=sharing), which is due Monday, Wednesday, January 28 at 8 am. You can do this at any time before then. The TAs are eager to meet you. art of becoming a professional is learning to manage your time both effectively and efficiently. Assignments with longer deadlines like this are best to do at your earliest convenience, and part of becoming a professional is to learn to manage your own calendar. Mark your calendar for your best evening to go that is well before the deadline, so you are not held up by any procrastinators who have not yet learned to manage their calendars, and who do everything at the very last minute.
