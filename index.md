## Day 4: Wednesday, August 30, 2024

### Day 4: In class

- Possible quiz
- Add our main Runestone book, by clicking [this link](https://moodle.berea.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=711327). You will end up on the main assignment page for the current textbook. You need to change courses to **bc_cppds_f24**.
- Questions on [L0: ASCII-Art](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14j_z0Q-HcVHP9KLok0PGk6o7U3wKpC7BN_tygccKfK8) which is due Friday. (Reminders about escaping backslashes and quotes.)
- Complete and submit [Teamwork T02: Collaboration via Branches](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fB24sIofHbsWZ2xJAQzCJ_RoIkfUhXZWYb0XJSjhAKQ) with a partner in class.
- Finished with the teamwork? Work on [L0: ASCII-Art](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14j_z0Q-HcVHP9KLok0PGk6o7U3wKpC7BN_tygccKfK8).

### Day 4: Outside of class

- Complete [L0: ASCII-Art](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14j_z0Q-HcVHP9KLok0PGk6o7U3wKpC7BN_tygccKfK8). The final submission is due on Friday.
- The next textbook reading is on object-oriented programming in C++ in the main textbook for the course. It is not due until Wednesday because there is no class on Monday, but it is a bit longer than the readings in the transition book, and you may find it more conceptually challenging. You can get to it from [this link](https://moodle.berea.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=711328) or from Moodle, but not just from Runestone. Be sure you are logged in and do all activities to get credit!

## Day 3: Monday, August 28, 2024

### Day 3: In class

- Possible quiz
- Discussion of [Teamwork T01: Visual Studio, Github, and ASCII Art](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bz1sbwxid1ydkSHaO5nDMpMgzwa29Py6zzTlWGUvBzM)
- Discuss [L0: ASCII-Art](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14j_z0Q-HcVHP9KLok0PGk6o7U3wKpC7BN_tygccKfK8) which is due Friday, but the first milestone is due Wednesday. (Read the hints in the lab on escaping backslashes and quotes!)
- show primer on branches in Github
- Begin [Teamwork T02: Collaboration via Branches](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fB24sIofHbsWZ2xJAQzCJ_RoIkfUhXZWYb0XJSjhAKQ) with a partner in class. We will complete this next time.

### Day 3: Outside of class

- Fix any challenges you have had with the first two readings by going through Moodle NOT Runestone Academy. See your grades for [Chapters 1 and 2 of C++ for Python Programmers and the course syllabus](https://moodle.berea.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=694947) and [Chapters 3, 4,and 5 in C++ for Python Programmers](https://moodle.berea.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=710347) and make them perfect by doing everything!
