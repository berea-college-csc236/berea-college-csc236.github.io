### Day 2: In class

- How did the sign-up for [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) go? Note that it might take more time to get this, so don't fret since we do not need Github Copilot and you are likely better off not using it for the first lab. You will need it for Lab L7, but there is plenty of time to get it before then.
