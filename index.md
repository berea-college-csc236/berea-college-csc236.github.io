### Day 2: In class

- Possible short quiz on reading R01.
- Debrief on installations, C++, the syllabus, and the AI policy in particular
- How did the sign-up for [Github Student Developer Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) go? Note that it might take more time to get this, so don't fret since we do not need Github Copilot and you are likely better off not using it for the first lab. You will need it for Lab L7, but there is plenty of time to get it before then - just be sure to work on it soon.
- Discuss the first lab, [L0: ASCII-Art](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14j_z0Q-HcVHP9KLok0PGk6o7U3wKpC7BN_tygccKfK8/edit?usp=sharing)
- Work to complete, then download, and submit [Teamwork T01: Visual Studio, Github, and ASCII Art](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Bz1sbwxid1ydkSHaO5nDMpMgzwa29Py6zzTlWGUvBzM). It is due by 8 am on Wednesday, January 21.

### Day 2: Outside of class (all due 8 am)

- Read [Chapters 3, 4,and 5 in C++ for Python Programmers](https://moodle.berea.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=799811) for a potential reading quiz on Wednesday. Be sure to go through the Moodle link to get full credit.
- Begin [L0: ASCII-Art](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14j_z0Q-HcVHP9KLok0PGk6o7U3wKpC7BN_tygccKfK8). This is an individual Lab. The first milestone is due Friday, January 23. The final completion milestone of the lab is due Monday, January 26.

  2. Connect Data Structures to your career
  3. Set-up your Required IDE (this will take some time!)
  4. Read the [syllabus](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11yEERg09nUcVji8k9yzUr6asPgpxqpVKSeccP5p4wOQ/edit?usp=sharing) to understand the course structure
  5. Read both [Chapters 1 and 2 of C++ for Python Programmers and the course syllabus](https://moodle.berea.edu/mod/lti/view.php?id=799810) in preparation for a potential reading quiz.
  6. Introduce yourself to the class and the TAs on Slack

- An additional assignment has been posted with a longer deadline. See [A01: Interview with a CSC 236 TA](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NtM4BUvfbsyYlgH63H92zRcvMYrIIYVDortntHz_nxg/edit?usp=sharing), which is due Wednesday, January 28 at 8 am. You can do this at any time before then. The TAs are eager to meet you. art of becoming a professional is learning to manage your time both effectively and efficiently. Assignments with longer deadlines like this are best to do at your earliest convenience, and part of becoming a professional is to learn to manage your own calendar. Mark your calendar for your best evening to go that is well before the deadline, so you are not held up by any procrastinators who have not yet learned to manage their calendars, and who do everything at the very last minute.
